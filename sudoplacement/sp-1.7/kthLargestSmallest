Given an array of N integers and an integer K. The task is to print the K-th smallest and K-th largest number in the array of numbers.  Multiple instances of same number are considered as different smallest/largest elements. For example, in {3, 3, 2}, second smallest is 3 and second largest is also 3.

Input:
The first line of input contains the number of test cases. First line of each test case contains N and K. Second line contains N numbers.

Output:
For every test case, print the K-th smallest and K-th largest number separated by space. 

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1 <= N <= 105  
1 <= K <= N
0 <= Ai <= 105

Example:
Input: 
2
4 3
1 3 2 5
4 2
3 3 3 3
Output: 
3 2
3 3

Explanation: 
Test case 1: 3 is the third smallest element and 2 is the third largest element in an array of N numbers. 
Testc case 2: 3 is second largest and 3 is second smallest.
